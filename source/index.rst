MultiLA software platform
=========================

Welcome to the documentation for the *MultiLA* software platform. This platform allows you to create web-based, interactive learning applications and track the user interactions with them for learning analytics.

This software platform was developed as part of the `IFAF MultiLA project`_ at the `HTW Berlin`_ and `HWR Berlin`_.

Main features
-------------

- create interactive learning applications via RMarkdown notation or as standard Shiny applications using the R package `learnrextra_` (an extension to the popular `learnr`_ R package)
- highly granular, configurable and anonymous tracking of user interactions with the learning applications: mouse movements, clicks, exercise submissions, etc.
- support for A/B-testing experiments and integrated surveys
- configurable learning applications: write base applications once, create variants via configurations
- dynamic summaries for learning applications
- web-based administration interface for publishing learning applications, setting up variants and experiments and downloading collected data
- data preparation and analysis scripts to get started with learning analytics for the collected data
- own your data â€“ self-hosted open-source solution to run in a Docker environment and an R shiny server

Live examples and screenshots
-----------------------------

An example learning application is available at `rshiny.f4.htw-berlin.de/BayesTheorem/ <https://rshiny.f4.htw-berlin.de/BayesTheorem/>`_. There is no demo of the administration interface publicly available. However, screenshots of the administration interface are among the following images:

        A learning application about Bayes' Theorem featuring interactive graphics and the dynamic summary panel on the right side.

        Visualized mouse movements from a tracking session.

Besides the learning application about Bayes' theorem, we also published learning applications about discrete and continuous probability distributions. These are however only available in German.
