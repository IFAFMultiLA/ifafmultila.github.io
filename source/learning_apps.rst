Creating learning applications
==============================

The *MultiLA* software platform authoring tool is based on an extension for the R package `learnr`_. This extension is called `learnrextra`_ and is so far not available on CRAN, but can be installed via GitHub (see instructions below). Writing learning applications or tutorials works the same as with learnr, but learnrextra provides some additional features which will be explained below.
